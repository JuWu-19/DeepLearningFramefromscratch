## Deep Learning Frame from scratch

In this project, we design a simple neural network from scratch with basic modules like Linear(fully connected
layers), Tanh, and ReLU and Sequential layers to combine several modules in basic sequential structure, loss
modules like MSE and BCE and optimizer modules like SGD and Adam. And then we test the framework
with a simple classification task.
